### üóÑÔ∏è Firebase Schema Description
#### Collections Structure
#### clients Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-doc-id",
  name: "string",           // Client's full name
  phone: "string"           // Phone number with country code
}
```
Example:

```javascript
{
  id: "abc123",
  name: "Sriram Kumar",
  phone: "+91-9876543210"
}
```
#### bookings Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-doc-id",
  clientId: "string",               // Reference to client document
  clientName: "string",             // Denormalized for quick access
  clientPhone: "string",            // Denormalized for quick access
  callType: "onboarding" | "follow-up",
  date: "string",                   // Format: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  time: "string",                   // Format: "HH:MM" (24-hour)
  duration: 40 | 20,                // Minutes (40 for onboarding, 20 for follow-up)
  isRecurring: boolean,             // true for follow-up calls
  recurringPattern?: {              // Only present if isRecurring = true
    frequency: "weekly",
    dayOfWeek: 0-6                  // Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6
  },
  createdAt: "string",              // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: "string"               // ISO timestamp
}
```
Example - Onboarding Call:

```javascript
{
  id: "def456",
  clientId: "abc123",
  clientName: "Sriram Kumar",
  clientPhone: "+91-9876543210",
  callType: "onboarding",
  date: "2025-07-26",
  time: "11:10",
  duration: 40,
  isRecurring: false,
  createdAt: "2025-07-26T10:30:00.000Z",

### Data Design Principles

1. Efficient Recurring Logic:
- Recurring calls are stored once with pattern metadata
- Backend logic determines which dates to display them on
- Prevents data duplication while maintaining flexibility

2. Denormalization for Performance:
- Client name and phone stored in bookings for quick retrieval
- Reduces the need for joins in calendar queries

3. Indexed Queries:
- Queries by date for daily calendar view
- Queries by isRecurring and dayOfWeek for recurring calls
- Composite indexes recommended for production

### üîÆ Key Assumptions Made
#### Business Logic Assumptions
1. Operating Hours:
- Business operates 10:30 AM to 7:30 PM
- 20-minute time slots throughout the day
- No booking outside these hours

2. Call Types:
- Onboarding calls: 40 minutes, one-time only
- Follow-up calls: 20 minutes, weekly recurring
- No other call types supported

3. Overlap Prevention:
- No two calls can overlap in time
- System validates conflicts across both one-time and recurring calls
- Booking blocked if any overlap detected

4. Recurring Logic:
- Follow-up calls repeat on the same weekday and time
- Recurring calls appear on all future dates matching the pattern
- Deleting a recurring call removes all future instances

#### Technical Assumptions
1. Client Data:
- 20 dummy clients pre-populated on first run
- Phone numbers follow Indian format (+91-xxxxxxxxxx)
- Client names are unique (no duplicate handling)

2. Date Handling:
- All dates stored in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Times stored in 24-hour HH:MM format
- Timezone assumed to be local (no UTC conversion)

3. Firebase Configuration:
- Firestore in test mode for development
- Production should implement proper security rules
- Service account has full admin privileges

4. API Design:
- RESTful endpoints for all operations
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- No authentication implemented (should be added in future)

#### UI/UX Assumptions
1. Single Day View:
- Calendar shows one day at a time
- Navigation via previous/next day buttons
- No month or week view implemented

2. Client Selection:
- Searchable dropdown for client selection
- Search works on both name and phone number
- No client creation from booking interface

3. Real-time Updates:
- Calendar refreshes after booking/deletion
- No WebSocket integration for multi-user scenarios
- Stats update immediately with calendar changes

### üß™ Testing
#### Manual Testing Checklist
- Create onboarding call (40 minutes)
- Create follow-up call (20 minutes, recurring)
- Verify overlap prevention
- Test recurring call display on future dates
- Delete bookings functionality
- Client search functionality
- Calendar navigation (previous/next day)
- Statistics update correctly

### API Endpoints
- GET /health - Health check
- GET /api/calendar/:date - Get calendar for specific date
- POST /api/bookings - Create new booking
- DELETE /api/bookings/:id - Delete booking
- GET /api/clients - Get all clients
